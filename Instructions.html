            <h2>Mine Sweeper - How to Play</h2>
            <p>The goal of Mine Sweeper is to find all the mines without blowing up.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You find mines by "stepping" on a square.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If it is safe, it will clear and reveal how many of the adjacent 9 squares contain mines
                            <br>
                            <img src="images/MSsafe.png" alt="when the middle square was clicked on, it revealed a 1 indicating there is one mine adjacent, which must be the northeast cell.">
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If it is a mine, you lose.
                            <br>
                            <img src="images/MSdeath.png" alt="the mine in the center was selected so the player lost.">
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can mark a squares that you think have a mine with a flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first square you click on is always safe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a square has no mines in its 9 adjacent squares, it will appear blank and all adjacent squares will be revealed.
                </li>
